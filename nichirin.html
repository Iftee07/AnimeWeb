    <h4>Nichirin Blades</h4>
    Nichirin Blades (日にち輪りん刀とう Nichirin tō) are special blades used by and made specifically for the Demon Slayer Corps to slay Demons. They are forged from a unique ore that constantly absorbs sunlight, one of the only major weaknesses of Demons. Therefore, decapitation by Nichirin Blade is one of the only ways a human can kill a Demon, the other being the use of a Wisteria-poison coated weapon.

<br><br>Nichirin Blades take on a distinct color when first drawn by its owner, which is why they are also referred to as <strong>"The Color Changing Swords"</strong>. However, the holder is required to have a certain amount of skill, or the blade will not change color.

    <h4>Forging Process</h4>
    Nichirin Blades are forged with Scarlet Crimson Iron Sand and Scarlet Crimson Ore, both of which are found on high mountains like the Sunlight Mountain, which is perpetually bathed in sunlight all throughout the year.

Demon Slayer recruits choose their own ore after successfully passing the Final Selection. The ore will then be used by a swordsmith of the Swordsmith Village during the forging process, and the swordsmith will personally bring the weapon to the Demon Slayer.

    <h4>Nichirin Blade Colours</h4>

    <br><br>The first sword color on this list is the white blade, which symbolizes mist. As such, the demon slayer who wields a white Nichirin Blade is Muichiro Tokito, the Mist Pillar of the Demon Slayer Corps. The Breath of Mist style is derived from the Breath of Wind.

Muichiro can be quite air-headed, constantly lost in his own thoughts and not being able to focus on one thing. There's just something about his personality that makes him perfect for the Breath of Mist style and the white Nichirin Blade.
