        <h4><u>Hashira: The Highest Rank of Demon Slayer Corps:</u></h4>
        The Hashira (柱はしら Hashira, lit. Pillars) are the nine most powerful swordsmasters in the Demon Slayer Corps. As such, they are the organization's top-ranking, most elite soldiers who each serve a pivotal role in their war against Muzan Kibutsuji.
        The Hashira are the nine strongest and most skilled combatants in the entirety of the Demon Slayer Corps, and they are regarded as the most potent swordsmen among all the Demon Slayers. Their existence literally sustains the entire organization.
        The Hashira, in accordance with their great strength, are the most highly ranked among Demon Slayers, second only to the Corps leader.
        The Hashira are all assigned a specific region that they are required to patrol, usually to gather information about the Demons inhabiting the said area and to improve their swordsmanship. Swordsmen who can use the Flame Breathing and Water Breathing have become Hashira in every era, with no exceptions thus far.

        <h4>1. Gyomei Himejima: Stone Hashira</h4>
        <img src="https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/kimetsu-no-yaiba/images/8/85/Gyomei_anime.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/350?cb=20200317170337">
        <br>Gyomei is a hulking figure among the Demon Slayers. He is one of the tallest characters in the series, easily towering over his fellow Hashira. He is powerfully built and extremely muscular. He has spiky black hair and a prominent scar running horizontally across his forehead. Having been blind since childhood, he has white eyes with no visible irises or pupils. His eyes frequently tear-up when he gets emotional.As a Hashira of the Demon Slayer Corps, Gyomei is a very powerful swordsman. He is stated by both Tanjiro and Inosuke to be the strongest Demon Slayer in the entire Demon Slayer Corps. This is further given credence by Upper Rank 1, Kokushibo, who noted that Gyomei's natural physical abilities have been trained to their absolute peak and also stated that in the last three hundred years, he has not encountered a warrior of Gyomei's caliber. He was able put up a fight against the strongest Upper Rank for a brief time without the use of his Demon Slayer Mark, further showing the extent of his skill.

        <h4>2. Giyu Tomioka: Water Hashira</h4>
        <img src="https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/kimetsu-no-yaiba/images/4/43/Giyu_anime_design.png/revision/latest?cb=20190831073602" width= "350px" height="500px">
        <br>As a Hashira of the Demon Slayer Corps, Giyu is a very powerful swordsman. He is able to easily defeat the Father Spider Demon in his transformed state and Rui, Lower Rank 5. During his fight against Akaza, Upper Rank 3, he was able to hold on his own for some time and like Kyojuro, Akaza is amazed by Giyu's skills to the point that he offers to transform the Hashira into Demon, something Akaza only asks of the most worthy of his opponents. Akaza states that he has not fought a Water Hashira as skilled as Giyu in fifty years. 
        Giyu is a tall young man of a muscular stature and pale complexion, who is almost always seen wearing an unimpressed or emotionless expression. He has unruly black hair of uneven lengths that sticks up in tufts around his head, which he wears tied back in a low messy ponytail at the base of his neck. His bangs fall over his eyes in an uneven fringe. His eyes are sharp and reasonably thin, their irises a deep sapphire that fades to a lighter blue and their pupils a bluish-black, and are framed by thin eyebrows.

        <h4>3. Kocho Shinobu: Insect Hashira</h4>
        <img src="https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/kimetsu-no-yaiba/images/e/e5/Shinobu_anime.png/revision/latest?cb=20200323234848"width= "350px" height="500px">
        <br>Despite not possessing the physical strength to cut off a Demon's head common to that of an average Demon Slayer or even the superhuman abilities possessed by her fellow Hashira, Shinobu is nonetheless as dangerous and deadly as the rest of them.
        Shinobu is a petite girl with pale skin and large, compound-looking eyes that do not possess pupils, only a haze of gradient purple, which make her eyes appear similar to those of bugs. She has shoulder-length wavy hair that fades from black into dark purple, usually styled at the back of her head into a "yakai-maki" style and fastened with a white and purple butterfly ornament. She has split ear-length bangs that rise a little away from her head before falling down to frame her face, with two thinner chin-length strands below them. Shinobu is rather short in height and has been described as having a small and weak-looking build, which is later reinforced by her saying that she does not possess enough physical strength to cut a Demon's head off as the other Hashira do. According to Zenitsu Agatsuma, Shinobu is so cute, that she could easily make a living on her looks alone.

        <h4>4. Kyojuro Rengoku: Flame Hashira</h4>
        ,<img src="https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/kimetsu-no-yaiba/images/f/fd/Kyojuro_anime.png/revision/latest?cb=20191117152140"width="350px" height="510px">
        <br>Kyojuro is a young adult of tall stature with bright yellow hair with red streaks, black forked eyebrows, and golden eyes.

His outfit consists of the regular Demon Slayer uniform along with a white-yellow gradient pattern and red flame-like ridges at the end.
As a Hashira of the Demon Slayer Corps, Kyojuro is a very powerful swordsman. Even Demons as strong as Akaza, Upper Rank 3 and the fourth-strongest of the known Demons, acknowledged Kyojuro's strength. He even went as far as to offer to turn Kyojuro into a Demon so he could surpass his human limits and become stronger, something he only offered to swordsmen whose abilities he believed were refined to their utmost. Akaza also complimented his battle spirit and stated that it is getting close to the "domain of supremacy," which meant that he is close to obtaining the transparent world, something only the strongest few Demon Slayers have access to. His father, Shinjuro Rengoku, stated that, after his son abandoned what he taught him, Kyojuro trained himself into the level of a Hashira after reading through an instruction book of the Flame Breathing style, a book which only had 3 volumes.

    <h4>5. Mitsuri Kanjori: Love Hashira</h4>
    <img src="https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/kimetsu-no-yaiba/images/7/74/Mitsuri_anime.png/revision/latest?cb=20190831171745"width="350px" height="510px">
    <br>Mitsuri is a young woman with fair skin and round, light green eyes with long eyelashes, a small mole beneath each of them. She has long, pink hair that fades into a neon green color at the halfway point, which she wears in three thick braids with five shorter clumps hanging over her face as bangs. When she was trying to get married, her hair was dyed black in an attempt to make herself look more "normal."
    Mitsuri wields a "Love Sword" that is extremely thin and soft like a whip. She possesses the fastest techniques of the Hashira due to the strong suppleness of her blade, the softness of her muscles, and the mobility of her joints. Due to the difficulty of wielding her sword, only she can use it. Like Shinobu Kocho, Obanai Iguro , Tengen Uzui, and Gyomei Himejima, the weapon Mitsuri wields was exclusively created for use by her. Unlike Shinobu and Gyomei, who used their unique weapons as compensation for their flaws (relatively weak body and blindness), Mitsuri uses her weapon to take advantage of her natural gifts.

    <h4>6. Muichiro Tokito: Mist Hashira</h4>
    <img src="https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/kimetsu-no-yaiba/images/f/f7/Muichiro_anime.png/revision/latest?cb=20190831171605"width="350px" height="510px">
    <br>Muichiro is a short, young man of light complexion with long, straight hair of a black color that fades to pale turquoise as it approaches his waist. He wears his hair loose with two clumps protruding slightly from each side of his head, a set of marginally shorter hair left down to frame his face, and unruly bangs over his forehead. He also possesses large, empty-looking mint-green eyes. His eyes and hair are traits shared with his twin brother, Yuichiro Tokito.
    As a Hashira of the Demon Slayer Corps, Muichiro is a very powerful swordsman. He is noted to be incredibly talented despite his young age, accomplishing his Hashira status after a mere two months of training. After awakening his Demon Slayer Mark, Muichiro is able to defeat Gyokko, Upper Rank 5, with relative ease even after the Upper Rank assumed his true form. His techniques were also praised by Kokushibo, Upper Rank 1, for being well developed for one so young. Despite this, Muichiro is still severely outmatched in his encounter with him, having his arm cut off after Kokushibo drew his blade for the first time. However, later on in the fight, his contributions proved to be crucial in Upper Rank One's defeat: After unlocking the Transparent World and the ability to dye his Nichirin Blade a crimson red color as well as the willingness to sacrifice his own life, Muichiro is able to land a critical blow on Upper Rank 1.

    <h4>7. Tengen Uzui: Sound Hashira</h4>
    <img src="https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/kimetsu-no-yaiba/images/0/07/Tengen_anime.png/revision/latest?cb=20191024210335"width="350px" height="510px">
    <br>Tengen is a very tall, wide-set man of a bulky, muscular build with lightly-tanned skin. His hair is white and of uneven length, the longest strands reaching his shoulders, and is styled with three more notable, shorter clumps arching up to fall as bangs between his eyes and on either side of his face. He has quite thin, maroon eyes that appear to slant inwards, each with one long eyelash flowing to the far side of his face. 
    As a Hashira of the Demon Slayer Corps, Tengen is a very powerful swordsman.[7] He has displayed numerous abilities that allow him to easily overpower Demons in a fight and even allow him to battle on par against the Upper Rank of the Twelve Kizuki. During his fight against Gyutaro, he was able to fight evenly with the Upper Rank 6 while protecting others at the same time, a feat made all the more impressive by the fact that he also had to fight off Daki as well during one point in the fight.

    <h4>8. Obanai Iguro: Serpent Hashira</h4>
    <img src="https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/kimetsu-no-yaiba/images/b/b2/Obanai_anime.png/revision/latest?cb=20190831171536"width="350px" height="510px">
    <br>Obanai is a young man of short stature and a pale complexion. He has straight-edged black hair of varying lengths, the longest reaching down to his shoulders and the shortest stopping at his cheekbones, which he wears down with two shorter strands hanging between his eyes. His eyes are almond-shaped and tilt upwards on the far sides, and are unusual due to Obanai possessing heterochromia—his right eye is yellow and his left eye is turquoise. He is partially blind as he can barely see out of his right eye.
    Although this may largely be down to the power of his crimson blade, Obanai is seen to be incredibly fast when in combat during his fight against Muzan. Even when blinded, he's able to swiftly jump in and save Tanjiro from what would likely have been a lethal stroke from Muzan's whips when he makes a blunder, and dodge many of his next attacks which instead annihilated the buildings in the surrounding area.

    <h4>9. Sanemi Shinazugawa: Wind Hashira</h4>
    <img src="https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/kimetsu-no-yaiba/images/c/cc/Sanemi_anime.png/revision/latest?cb=20190831171507"width="350px" height="510px">
    <br>Sanemi is a tall, muscular, and slender man with spiky white hair and large eyes. His face and body are covered with scars, accrued over his many years of fighting demons. He cuts his hair short somewhere in between the Functional Recovery Training Arc and the Demon Train Arc.   
    Sanemi has also shown the ability to manipulate his own muscles to close up and prevent fatal and mortal wounds from opening up and bleeding out during mid battle, as seen when he was fatally slashed and cut up across his abdomen by Kokushibo, he was still able to fight on by manipulating his own muscles to close up his wounds.
    Sanemi's blood was revealed to be one of the rarest blood types, making it incredibly intoxicating and mouth watering to demons. It is also unique due to its intense potency that the smallest whiff of his blood immediately causes demons to salivate and lose focus, as his blood was able to affect the strongest of the Upper Ranks, Kokushibo.
