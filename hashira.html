        <h4>Hashira: The Highest Rank of Demon Slayer Corps.</h4>
        The Hashira (柱はしら Hashira, lit. Pillars) are the nine most powerful swordsmasters in the Demon Slayer Corps. As such, they are the organization's top-ranking, most elite soldiers who each serve a pivotal role in their war against Muzan Kibutsuji.
        <br>The Hashira are the nine strongest and most skilled combatants in the entirety of the Demon Slayer Corps, and they are regarded as the most potent swordsmen among all the Demon Slayers. Their existence literally sustains the entire organization.
        The Hashira, in accordance with their great strength, are the most highly ranked among Demon Slayers, second only to the Corps leader.
        The Hashira are all assigned a specific region that they are required to patrol, usually to gather information about the Demons inhabiting the said area and to improve their swordsmanship. Swordsmen who can use the Flame Breathing and Water Breathing have become Hashira in every era, with no exceptions thus far.

        <br>Gyomei is a hulking figure among the Demon Slayers. He is one of the tallest characters in the series, easily towering over his fellow Hashira. He is powerfully built and extremely muscular. He has spiky black hair and a prominent scar running horizontally across his forehead. Having been blind since childhood, he has white eyes with no visible irises or pupils. His eyes frequently tear-up when he gets emotional.As a Hashira of the Demon Slayer Corps, Gyomei is a very powerful swordsman.[4] He is stated by both Tanjiro and Inosuke Hashibira to be the strongest Demon Slayer in the entire Demon Slayer Corps.[5] This is further given credence by Upper Rank 1, Kokushibo, who noted that Gyomei's natural physical abilities have been trained to their absolute peak and also stated that in the last three hundred years, he has not encountered a warrior of Gyomei's caliber.[6] He was able put up a fight against the strongest Upper Rank for a brief time without the use of his Demon Slayer Mark, further showing the extent of his skill.

        <br>As a Hashira of the Demon Slayer Corps, Giyu is a very powerful swordsman.[12] He is able to easily defeat the Father Spider Demon in his transformed state[13] and Rui, Lower Rank 5.[14] During his fight against Akaza, Upper Rank 3, he was able to hold on his own for some time and like Kyojuro, Akaza is amazed by Giyu's skills to the point that he offers to transform the Hashira into Demon, something Akaza only asks of the most worthy of his opponents.[15] Akaza states that he has not fought a Water Hashira as skilled as Giyu in fifty years. 
        Giyu is a tall young man of a muscular stature and pale complexion, who is almost always seen wearing an unimpressed or emotionless expression. He has unruly black hair of uneven lengths that sticks up in tufts around his head, which he wears tied back in a low messy ponytail at the base of his neck. His bangs fall over his eyes in an uneven fringe. His eyes are sharp and reasonably thin, their irises a deep sapphire that fades to a lighter blue and their pupils a bluish-black, and are framed by thin eyebrows.
