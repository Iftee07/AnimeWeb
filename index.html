            <h4>Story</h4>
            The story takes place in Taishō-era Japan. 
            It follows protagonist Tanjiro Kamado and his 
            sister Nezuko Kamado as they seek for a cure to 
            Nezuko's demon curse. Tanjiro and Nezuko become 
            entangled in the affairs of a secret society, known 
            as the Demon Slayer Corps, that have been waging a 
            secret war against demons for centuries. The demons 
            are former humans who sold their humanity in exchange 
            for power, they feed on humans and possess super natural 
            abilities such as super strength, magic and regeneration. 
            Demons can only be killed if they're decapitated with 
            weapons crafted from an alloy known as Sun Steel, injected with poison extracted from wisteria flowers, or exposed to sunlight. The Demon Slayers, on the other hand, are entirely human, however, they employ special breathing techniques, known as breaths, which grant them superhuman strength and increased resistance.

            <h4>Demon Slayer Corps</h4>
            The Demon Slayer Corps (鬼き殺さつ隊たい <em>Kisatsutai</em>) is an organization that has existed since ancient times, dedicating its existence to protecting humanity from Demons. There are hundreds of Demon Slayers within the organization, however they are not officially recognized by the government. With Muzan Kibutsuji's demise and the near-extinction of the Demon race, the Corps officially disbanded.
