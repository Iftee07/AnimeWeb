    <h4>Total Concentration Breathing:</h4>
    Breathing Styles are swordsmanship forms practiced and taught by the Demon Slayer Corps. The Breathing Styles make use of specific and concentrated breath patterns, which increase the user's lung capacity and amount of oxygen in the blood. This increase of oxygen allows the user to enhance their physical abilities and mental concentration, allowing them to fight on par with Demons, whose physical prowess surpasses that of the average human.

    Focused Breathing is also capable of clotting wounds from severe injuries and slowing down the circulation of poison in the bloodstream.
    
    All known Breathing Styles currently taught within the Demon Slayer Corps are derived from the Sun Breathing, the first one ever created.

    <h4>Insect Breathing:</h4>
    Insect Breathing (蟲むしの呼こ吸きゅう Mushi no kokyū?)[1] is a Breathing Style branched out from the Flower Breathing, which itself is branched out of the Water Breathing.

This style is the personal creation of Shinobu Kocho, who designed it to compensate for her lack of physical strength to cut off a Demon's head. The sword style's main focus is stabbing, thrusting, and making shallow cuts with a specially coated/made sword to inflict multiple wounds onto the intended target in order to inject various lethal Wisteria-based poisons into the intended target.
