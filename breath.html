    <h4><u>Total Concentration Breathing:</u></h4>
    Breathing Styles are swordsmanship forms practiced and taught by the Demon Slayer Corps. The Breathing Styles make use of specific and concentrated breath patterns, which increase the user's lung capacity and amount of oxygen in the blood. This increase of oxygen allows the user to enhance their physical abilities and mental concentration, allowing them to fight on par with Demons, whose physical prowess surpasses that of the average human.
    Focused Breathing is also capable of clotting wounds from severe injuries and slowing down the circulation of poison in the bloodstream.
    All known Breathing Styles currently taught within the Demon Slayer Corps are derived from the Sun Breathing, the first one ever created.

    <h4>Insect Breathing</h4>
    Insect Breathing (蟲むしの呼こ吸きゅう Mushi no kokyū?)[1] is a Breathing Style branched out from the Flower Breathing, which itself is branched out of the Water Breathing.
    This style is the personal creation of Shinobu Kocho, who designed it to compensate for her lack of physical strength to cut off a Demon's head. The sword style's main focus is stabbing, thrusting, and making shallow cuts with a specially coated/made sword to inflict multiple wounds onto the intended target in order to inject various lethal Wisteria-based poisons into the intended target.

    Sound Breathing (音おとの呼こ吸きゅう Oto no kokyū?) is a Breathing Style unique only to the Sound Hashira Tengen Uzui. The Sound Breathing is branched out from the Thunder Breathing. This Breathing involves using a battle strategy called a "Score", which involves Uzui reading his opponents movements and deconstructing them into sound by analyzing the rhythm of their movements. Through this, he is able to take advantage of their openings to much greater effect by striking in a way similar to making the beat to a song. In conjunction with this, he uses small but powerful anti-demon bombs made with a special gunpowder that are capable of overpowering an Upper Rank Demon briefly.

    <h4>Wind Breathing</h4>
    Wind Breathing (風かぜの呼こ吸きゅう Kaze no Kokyū?) is one of the five Breathing Styles derived directly from the Sun Breathing. The Breathing Style was originally developed & taught by Yoriichi Tsugikuni to an unknown student, who could not master the Sun Breathing and was instead trained in a specific alternative breathing style to better suit his student's specific strengths and weaknesses eventually becoming an independent breathing all together. The same is applicable for the other main Branch Breathing Styles.[1]
    The Beast Breathing, despite being independently developed by Inosuke Hashibira, is a derivative of the Wind Breathing, so it can be assumed that both styles use an enhanced sense of touch in their techniques.
    The Mist Breathing is also noted to have been originally a derivative of the Wind Breathing.

    <h4>Flame Breathing</h4>
    Flame Breathing (炎ほのおの呼こ吸きゅう Honō no kokyū?) is one of the five main Breathing Styles directly derived from Sun Breathing. The Breathing Style of the Flame Breathing seemed to have been developed by a distant ancestor of the Rengoku Family, who was originally a student of Yoriichi Tsugikuni. It can be assumed that this student attempted to master the Sun Breathing but, due to him not being as innately powerful as Yoriichi, his teacher altered his Breathing Style training in order to better focus on his students individual strengths and weaknesses. Eventually, his student continued to develop and train this style until it became its own unique breathing and was subsequently named the Flame Breathing. Since then, this particular Breathing Style has been passed down and taught through generations of his descendants and the future members of the Demon Slayer Corps.

    It is said to be the most common Breathing Style among Demon Slayers due to being the easiest to learn for beginners.

    <h4>Moon Breathing</h4>
    Moon Breathing (月つきの呼こ吸きゅう Tsuki no kokyū?) is a Breathing Style derived from the Sun Breathing[1] used by Upper Rank 1, Kokushibo, who was one of the first Demon Slayers who utilized breathing techniques. The techique allows the user to create many "chaotic blades" when slashing that vary in length and size. It is known that Kokushibo continued to develop and add techniques to the Breathing Style over the centuries as an immortal Demon. At this point in the story, it is the only known Breathing Style to possess at least 16 different techniques, easily surpassing the other Breathing Styles.
    It has been revealed that, like all of the other original breathing styles, the Moon Breathing also branched out of the Sun Breathing. When its creator, Michikatsu Tsugikuni, attempted to learn the Sun Breathing from his twin brother, Yoriichi Tsugikuni, he discovered he was unable to master the breathing style and so was instead trained in a alternate Breathing Style. Yoriichi created it fit and cover his individual strengths and weaknesses, and Michikatsu then continued to train and develop this breathing until it eventually evolved into its own unique Breathing Style, which he named Moon Breathing.

    <h3>Attacks:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>First Form: Dark Moon - Evening Palace-</strong>Kokushibo draws his sword and slashes swiftly in a single motion; like with all Moon Breathing techniques, numerous chaotic blades originate from the slash. This technique resembles Iaido.</li>
        <img src="Dark_Moon_Evening_Palace.png">
        <li><strong>Second Form: Pearl Flowers Moongazing-</strong>Kokushibo performs several slashes while sending a barrage of chaotic blades forward.</li>
        <img src="Volcanic_Rock_Rapid_Conquest (1).png">
        <li><strong>Third Form: Loathsome Moon - Chains-</strong>Kokushibo swings his sword rapidly in two crescent slashes, from which a storm of smaller crescents spread. This technique causes huge destruction in a small area.</li>
        <img src="Loathsome_Moon_Chains.png">
        <li><strong>Fifth Form: Moon Spirit Calamitous Eddy-</strong>Kokushibo makes multiple curved slashes layered over one another, resembling a rising vortex. Numerous chaotic blades originate from these slashes. Kokushibo performed this attack without swinging his blade.</li>
        <img src="Moon_Spirit_Calamitous_Eddy.png">
        <li><strong>Sixth Form: Perpetual Night, Lonely Moon - Incessant-</strong>Kokushibo releases a wild storm of slashes in multiple directions. This technique was powerful enough to not only slice up multiple Hashira around him but also overwhelm the Wind Hashira Sanemi Shinazugawa.</li>
        <img src="Perpetual_Night_Lonely_Moon_Incessant.png">
        <li><strong>Seventh Form: Mirror of Misfortune - Moonlit-</strong>Kokushibo swings his sword in a powerful frontal slash that then creates a multi directional frontal assault, powerful enough to create several deep gouges in the ground and push back two Hashira.</li>
        <img src="Mirror_of_Misfortune_Moonlit.png">
        <li><strong>Eighth Form: Moon-Dragon Ringtail-</strong>Kokushibo uses a direct frontal attack that creates a single gigantic slash.</li>
        <img src="Moon_Dragon_Ringtail.png">
        <li><strong>Ninth Form: Waning Moonswaths</strong>Kokushibo creates a seemingly endless stream of slashes, capable of cutting down his intended target from a long range</li>
        <img src="Waning_Moonswaths.png">
        <li><strong>Tenth Form: Drilling Slashes - Moon Through Bamboo Leaves-</strong>Kokushibo creates a triple-layered slash twister, capable of mowing down his targets into three clean pieces.</li>
        <img src="Drilling_Slashes_Moon_Through_Bamboo_Leaves.png">
        <li><strong>Fourteenth Form: Catastrophe - Tenman Crescent Moon-</strong> Kokushibo swings his sword and creates a chaotic vortex of powerful omni-directional slashes that destroys whatever is caught up within its attack radius.</li>
        <img src="Catastrophe_Tenman_Crescent_Moons.png">
        <li><strong>Sixteenth Form: Moonbow - Half Moon-</strong>Kokushibo swings his sword in a downward slash, resulting in a powerful sixfold slash crashing down on his opponents; the attack itself is powerful enough to create several miniature craters where the slashes have landed.</li>

    <h4>Sun Breathing/Hinokami Kagura</h4>
    <p>
        <h5>Hinokami Kagura</h5>
        The Hinokami Kagura (ヒノカミ神楽かぐら Hinokami Kagura?, lit. Dance of the Fire God) is a Breathing Style only known and taught by the Kamado family.
        It is passed on from father to son in every generation alongside the hanafuda earrings. The Kamado family uses the breathing style within a ritual ceremony practiced every new year, where the Breathing Style user offers the Fire God a dance from sunset to sunrise to ward off diseases.
        The dance is composed of twelve segments repeated throughout the night. The last user is Tanjiro Kamado, who learned the breathing style from his father, Tanjuro Kamado. Though, other people can learn this, if taught by a Kamado.
        <h5>Sun Breathing:</h5>
        Sun Breathing (日ひの呼こ吸きゅう Hi no kokyū?) is a style of swordsmanship utilized by the first Demon Slayer to use "breaths", Yoriichi Tsugikuni, and serves as the basis for other Breathing Styles derived from it as a result of Yoriichi changing the breathing techniques to suit the individuals he taught. The derived styles eventually branched out into the main breathing styles: Water Breathing, Flame Breathing, Wind Breathing, Thunder Breathing, Stone Breathing, and Moon Breathing. Before Kokushibo died, he mentions that all swordsman who knew of the Sun Breathing were killed by him and Muzan Kibutsuji, before proceeding to question why the Sun Breathing still persists due to the existence of the Hinokami Kagura (ヒノカミ神楽かぐら Hinokami Kagura?).
        Kokushibo and Shinjuro Rengoku independently identified the Hinokami Kagura as the Sun Breathing, the latter through the memories of his Demon-slaying ancestor. The two styles were later confirmed to be the same. There is a (previously unknown) thirteenth form, which can be learned from the Sun Breathing as a Hinokami Kagura User, that is achieved by completing the twelve movements in succession.
        However, Tanjiro remained uncertain of the breathing style's true nature until he gained access to the memories of his ancestor, Sumiyoshi. His ancestor's wife, Suyako, requested to see the Sun Breathing performed during Yoriichi's last visit to the family. Sumiyoshi memorized the movements and was gifted the hanafuda earrings by Yoriichi before parting. The breathing style and earrings were then secretly passed on from father to son in the Kamado family every generation as a rite of passage. Henceforth, the Sun Breathing became known as the Hinokami Kagura.

    <h3>Attacks:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Dance-</strong> A single high-powered vertical slash.<br><img src="Tanjiro_cutting_Rui27s_threads_with_Hinokami_Kagura_Dance.gif"><ul><li><strong>Flash Dance-</strong> First used by Tanjiro Kamado. The user utilizes a similar method like the Thunderclap and Flash technique of the Thunder Breathing, allowing them to use an advanced version of Dance by inhaling huge amounts of oxygen, increasing the pumping of blood through the entire body, focusing it on the legs, and releasing it all to assault the target with a slash. This technique was capable of outspeeding Genya Shinazugawa and Nezuko Kamado, as well as the fleeing Hantengu, although it is still said to be slower than Zenitsu Agatsuma's Thunderclap and Flash.<br><img src="Hinokami_Kagura_-_Flash (1).png"></li></ul></li>
        <li><strong>Clear Blue Sky</strong>The user spins their body vertically to create a 360-degree slash. It is likely the model to the Water Breathing: Second Form - "Water Wheel."</li>

        <li><strong>Raging Sun</strong>The user unleashes two horizontal slashes to hit or intercept an enemy from the front or side.</li>
        <img src="Hinokami_Kagura_-_Raging_Sun.png">
        <li><strong>Fake Rainbow</strong>The user utilizes this technique to evade incoming attacks with high-speed twists and rotations, thus creating afterimages. The afterimages work most effectively on enemies with good vision as they will probably fail attack the afterimage instead of the actual body of the user.</li>
        <img src="Hinokami_Kagura_-_Fake_Rainbow.png">
        <li><strong>Fire Wheel</strong>The user leaps behind the opponent and spins in the air while releasing a flaming attack in a circular motion.</li>
        <img src="Hinokami.png">
        <li><strong>Burning Bones, Summer Sun</strong> A circular slash that defends from imminent frontal attacks.</li>
        <img src="Hinokami_Kagura_-_Burning_Bones2C_Summer_Sun.png">
        <li><strong>Sunflower Thrust</strong> A single thrust attack with the point of the blade.</li>
        <img src="Hinokami_Kagura_-_Sunflower_Thrust.png">
        <li><strong>Solar Heat Haze</strong>The user charges towards the target, attacking it with a haze covered slash that seemingly fails to land, but actually does hit the target.</li>
        <img src="Hinokami_Kagura_-_Solar_Heat_Haze.png">
        <li><strong>Setting Sun Transformation</strong>The user flips into the air to deliver an upended flaming sword slash.</li>
        <img src="Hinokami_Kagura_-_Setting_Sun_Transformation.png">
        <li><strong>Beneficent Radiance</strong>The user spirals into the air to deliver a powerful slash to those caught in it.</li>
        <img src="Hinokami_Kagura_-_Beneficent_Radiance.png">
        <li><strong>Dragon Sun Halo Head Dance</strong> Resembling a dragon, the user moves in circles to avoid enemy attacks and slashes then multiple times at the target. This technique was first utilized by Tanjiro in conjunction with Nezuko's Blood Demon Art Blood Burst to enhance the effectiveness.</li>
        <img src="Hinokami_Kagura_-_Solar_Halo_Dragon_Dance.png">
        <li><strong>Flame Dance</strong> A two-combo strike which starts with a vertical slash and then a horizontal one right after</li>
        <img src="Hinokami_Kagura_-_Flame_Dance.png">
        <li><strong>Thirteenth Form</strong>The user continuously performs all twelve forms of the breathing style in repetitive succession to increase the accuracy and agility of his movements while reducing fatigue. This form was created solely for the purpose of killing Muzan, since the repetition of all twelve forms aims to destroy Muzan's twelve vital organs (seven hearts and five brains) that move freely inside his body thanks to his shape-shifting ability.</li>
